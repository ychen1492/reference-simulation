# Geothermal Reference Simulation

## Resolution and the number of confining layers

Conceptual reservoir models are applied extensively to investigate the thermal response and to understand the physics during geothermal production. Constructing a conceptual geothermal reservoir model is important at the initial phase of numerical simulation. It is vital to know the resolution and the number of the confining layers to accurately capture the thermal response and enough heat recharging from the confining layers.


- Homogeneouse reservoir

  - Constant permeability and porosity
  - Constant mass rate control

- Stratified reservoir
- Heterogeneous reservoir
